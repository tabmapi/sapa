    "* sample : This is a string, used to name the output files and to create the monitoring file. It should contain information                such as the material being studied, e.g. for a first run of ScF3, sample = 'ScF3' should suffice. This can be                  changed by editing the input file after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* filenameformat : This is a string to allow for looping over the PDF data files. For SAPA, you should make sure your data                        files have a consistent name format, e.g. for this tutorial, all files are of the format                                        'ScF3_tempK_dofr.xye', where temp is the temperature the data was collected at. I can then supply a list of                    temperatures to the execute command. For the filenameformat variable, the thing you are replacing each time                    (temp for this example) should be replaced by ##n##. A macro in TOPAS replaces 'n' with the temperature you                    want to execute, and the two ## tell the TOPAS interpreter to join the temperature to the rest of the                          string.\n",

    "* qmax : The maximum value of Q used to generate the PDF data. This is a float.\n",

    "* alpha : Alpha parameter for Q-dependent broadening. Note - this is default 0, since including it slows down refinements                 considerably. This is a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "* filename : The filename for the created input file. By default, this is 'batch_modes.inp'. This requires a .inp extension.                This is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* refine_angles : False by default; set to True if you want to refine angle lattice parameters.\n",
